# WP PW Pages and Posts

This plugin is forked from the excellent and simple [Smart Passworded Pages](https://wordpress.org/plugins/smart-passworded-pages/) by Brian Layman.  

## Purpose
The purpose of this is to act as a 'concierge' service to avoid the need to create specific links to pages/posts where you have a number of potential redirect targets.

## Features

The plugin allows the site administrator to provide a password input form via a shortcode, in order to search relevant 'child' pages match - and subsequently redirect to that page.

The functionality has been extended to allow searching of posts rather than child pages.  The posttype can be specified, to target posts created by other plugins.
