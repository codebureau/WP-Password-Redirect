# Introduction

### Welcome!

Thank you for considering contributing to WP Password Redirect. This is a great way to improve the plugin.

Code contributions and pull requests, bug reports via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/codebureau/WP-Password-Redirect/issues), in addition to improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all great examples meaningful contributions.

As the plugin is fundamentally targeted in its functionality, we don't forsee significant changes in design or approach.  Having said that, there will always be potential code improvements, and/or additional functionality in the form of more flexible options for:

- identification of target pages/posts
- redirection to target pages/posts
