Wordpress Passworded Pages and Posts

Forked from https://thecodecave.com/plugins/smart-passworded-pages/ due to inactivity, and my need to expand the options for target pages.

The plugin will currently look for 'descendent pages' from the page where the [smartwppages] shortcode is entered.  

I need this to be more flexible, and actually search through custom post types - namely WP Download manager 'download packages', as I need to provide a concierge service whereby....

A central 'download page' will receive a user password, and then redirect to the first 'download package' if finds with the custom post type 'wpdmpro' that has the entered password.  I'll get that working first, then see where we end up from there...
